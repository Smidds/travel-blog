  "body": "# Arrival\n\nIt was my first time visiting New York City, and we were definitely thrown right into the most busy, lively version of it! We took the train from Newark airport to Penn Station, and stepping out onto 8th street was so jarring and exhilarating. There was a man on a trombone playing Christmas music, tourists like us shuttling large suitcases through the crowds, New Yorkers literally calling out to aggressive drivers, \"Hey, I'm walking here!\" It was a dream come true, New York City alive and bustling all in preparation for the ball drop just 36 hours away!\n\nW﻿e had our own luggage to lug around to our friends apartment, but thankfully our backpacks made for easily travels through the streets. Once we all got together it was an enormous relief to put those bags down and catch up. We ate loads of lovely snacks, and got dinner at this great Italian restaurant called [Sicily](https://goo.gl/maps/zvuH2tqYpeRurReA6) just a few blocks from where we were staying in Hells Kitchen.\n\nW﻿ith full stomachs we set off for a rooftop bar to get an excellent view of the city and some boozy hot chocolates. The bar was absolutely packed with people and we spent a lot of time struggling to find seats, but once we did we made ourselves comfortable inside one of those plastic igloo domes and got cozy. We really would have preferred to sit outside since the weather was absolutely incredible, but it was really nice to sit away from the crowds and have a quieter space to ourselves.\n\nO﻿n New Years Day we decided to walk down towards Lower Manhattan on the High Line trail and take in the throngs of people for the ball drop, as well as some incredible architecture and, what I would call, a fantastic display of urban reclamation. I really loved the High Line trail and found walking along those old rails with the trees and grasses growing to be really grounding in all the noise and energy of the city, at least as much as it could be while literal hundreds of people push past you while walking the trail. Once we got to the end of it we were in Greenwich Village and we took a moment to walk all those pretty cobblestone streets and oggle at the multi-million dollar houses (One house was listed for $12.5 million!). We got a little hungry, and thankfully we were near this great brunch spot called Rosemary's so we decided to take a seat, rest our feet, and eat some focaccia, golden beets (the star of the meal), and have a drink.\n\nF﻿rom here we decided to split up (I grabbed a veggie burger from a bodega nearby which was honestly an amazing decision) and Gita and I wandered around Noho and Soho, stopping by Washington Square Park, NYU, and a great little matcha shop called Matchaful on Canal St. We then took the subway (my first time!) up to Hell's Kitchen and got ready for our New Years Eve festivities!\n\nI﻿n the spirit of keeping things lower-key to avoid the enormous crowds in and around Times Square, we decided to do an early dinner at a nice sushi restaurant called Katsuya near the Hudson Yards. We shared a bottle of sparkling sake, which I didn't know was a thing, and talked about our resolution plans and and general plans for the new year and on. Afterwards we walked back towards our friends apartment and stopped into a small bar called Rudy's where we were greeted by the largest most definitely over the buildings legal capacity crowd I'd ever seen in a bar since being a student at UIUC. We took a shot of tequila each, talked about maybe getting so more drinks, saw the crowd at the bar, and decided we'd rather make our own cocktails at the apartment. So off we went! From there place we counted down the New Year, took some pictures, played some music, and it was a really special night.\n\nT﻿he next morning we hit up Hudson Bagels and got some fantastic bagels and cream cheese, and then Gita and I made our way to Central Park for an urban \"hike.\" To get there we bolded ventured into Times Square to see what kind of chaos remained and it was really something crazy. Confetti from the night before was still blowing around the Square, getting picked up on breezes and dropped in places only to be lifted again moments later.\n\nO﻿nce we had our fill of the beating heart of the city we made our way to 30 Rockefeller for some classic sight-seeing. We stopped by the Radio City Music Hall (took some pictures), the 30 Rock building and ice rink (took some pictures), and St. Patrick's Cathedral (didn't take any pictures, didn't feel appropriate I suppose). All the way Gita and I talked about the city, what we thought about it, the crowds, the architecture. I really loved seeing so many people and hearing so many languages, but it really was just an overwhelming sea of human beings each going about their lives with such force and conviction that it's hard to feel anything but in the way! Still, there's something special about the city that never sleeps, and definitely very exciting.\n\nO﻿nce in Central Park though, all the crowds and chaos dropped away. We ended up walking the full length of the park into Harlem and it was amazing! It's crazy to me that just stepping into the park brings so much peace and quiet when right on either end of you to the East or West is this never-ending traffic and honking and bustling of these enormous crowds. The park itself was pretty jammed full of people, but since it truly is just so large it was hardly a detractor from the gorgeous sunlight and breeze we got. We really were lucky with the weather- we were so concerned with bringing warm layers and needing to mail things back to keep our backpacks light for our long travels but we ended up being nice and warm in what was effectively a false spring.\n\nO﻿nce we got to Harlem we set out to see Columbia's main campus which was absolutely stunning in the sunset, and then we made our way up to their medical campus up in the Heights via the subway (ride #2!). We poked our heads into a few buildings, asked for and were denied access to the main lecture hall Gita would be studying in, checked out the apartments nearby since you never know, and made our way back down to Hell's Kitchen for some truly great Thai food at Zoob Zib on 9th Avenue."
