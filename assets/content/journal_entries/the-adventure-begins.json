  "body": "# Before We Go...\n\nBefore we even left for Thailand, Gita and I had a lot of our work cut out for us. To begin the process we first signed up for a TEFL course through the company [MyTEFL](https://mytefl.com/). We purchased the extra \"internship\" package hoping that we would be able to get job placements in Thailand or Vietnam through their partner agency, [XploreAsia](https://www.xploreasia.org/). A few weeks in to taking the coursework and emailing documents to our coordinator with MyTEFL it became clear to Gita and I that the global COVID-19 pandemic was not going to end any time soon and our hope began to waver. Days went by without any sort of clear communication from MyTEFL and the bad news kept rolling in in the form of grim headlines and disheartening presidential debates when, like a miracle, on July 20th we get an email scheduling a meeting with our coordinator in XploreAsia to hash out the specifics and get us on our way to Thailand! Our target date, as of that initial meeting, appeared to be the end of August, assuming all went well, which worked perfectly with the end of our lease in Logan Square. Unfortunately, as some of you reading this already know, that end of August date was overshot by two months due to COVID induced delays and added logistical complications seeing as all visa application work had to be done by mail and ahead of our arrival in Thailand (the program typically has a different process in normal, global heath circumstances, so this was new territory for everyone). After several months of planning, coordinating, mailing, scheduling, and desperately crossing our fingers, that fantastic, lovely email arrived bestowing upon the two of us all the documents we needed to apply for our Thai visas.\n\nWith visa documents in hand the countdown clock to Thailand had officially begun. What was up until that point a fantasy based on shaky grounds due to the global situation had suddenly become a very real, tangible future for the both of us. We religiously filled out our forms, signed our applications, dotted our I's and crossed our T's, and mailed them off, holding our collective breath. 21 endless days later we finally had our visas, COEs (Certificate of Entry), and a job waiting for us at [Prachuap Wittayalai school](https://goo.gl/maps/JUHn7XYjHJGRJieU9) in [Prachuapkirikhan](https://goo.gl/maps/fPbaVkGkv6khbW959). \n\n# First Stop, ORD\n\nWith all documents from Thailand assembled, degrees legalized, and hopes thoroughly improved, we had only three final steps to take before we got to Thailand:\n\n1. Get a Fit-To-Fly certificate indicating we are of good health\n2. Obtain a COVID-19 within 72 hours of the flight showing we are COVID-negative\n3. Get on that damn plane\n\nObviously, that third step goes without saying, but boy did it feel like a step of its own. \n\nObtaining the COVID test was a breeze, the [Midwest Express Clinic in Willowbrook](https://midwestexpressclinic.com/locations/willowbrook-il/) was able to get us in for an appointment on Thanksgiving morning with no questions asked. We were extremely pleased with how professional, flexible, and, most importantly, quick they were. Our Fit-To-Fly certificate needed to be done at another facility (the one in [Wicker Park](https://midwestexpressclinic.com/locations/bucktown-wicker-park-chicago-il-urgent-care/)) and thankfully we could get a walk-in appointment that Saturday without any trouble. In less than an hour we walked out with our certificate, and the following day our COVID test results came back to us, negative, completing all the final documents we needed! All that was left was for us to pack and print the 160 pieces of paper (that's the real number!) that made up all the documents we would need to travel.\n\n<div class=\"captioned-image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dfkk9455p/image/upload/v1607420175/Packing_Chaos_ntxi3k.jpg\" alt=\"A mess of clothes and other items with open suitcases in my parent's attic\" title=\"Packing chaos in my parent's attic\" /><div class=\"image-caption\">My parents were extremely kind to lend us their attic for our packing chaos, which we made ample use of!</div></div>\n\nThe final 48-ish hours were a whirlwind of activity involving a flurry of packing and goodbyes, but finally on November 30th we made our way to the airport with Gita's parents (who kindly took our car back to their garage!), said our goodbyes, and stepped into Terminal 5.\n\n<div class=\"captioned-image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dfkk9455p/image/upload/v1607410549/O_Hare_Selfie_kfimdl.jpg\" alt=\"A quick selfie of Gita and myself in Terminal 5 with a nearly empty terminal in the background\" title=\"A selfie with no one around\" /><div class=\"image-caption\">A quiet and festive Terminal 5.</div></div>\n\nIt was eerily quiet. Given the current travel situation in the states it was understandable, and I even anticipated it, but I was still taken aback by just how empty and silent the place was. Gita and I made our way to the Qatar Airways desk where we saw a sign informing us that our flight was ***the only flight*** of the day, and that the desk would close promptly at one hour prior to take-off. We were there several hours in advance, but we were still surprised to learn that our flight was the only one! Shortly after we got in line it became clear that almost everyone around us must be getting on that same flight as all the other check-in desks for other airlines were near empty and unstaffed.\n\n<div class=\"captioned-image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dfkk9455p/image/upload/v1607410603/O_Hare_ysr4dk.jpg\" alt=\"A nearly empty Terminal 5 at O'Hare on November 30th\" title=\"Hardly anyone around us in the Qatar Airways check-in line at Terminal 5\" /><div class=\"image-caption\">It was eerily empty for a post-Thanksgiving Monday at Terminal 5.</div></div>\n\nAfter presenting our Fit-To-Fly certificate, COVID test results, passport with visa, quarantine hotel accommodations (ASQ), and insurance indicating COVID-19 coverage up to $100,000, we were approved, our luggage taken away, and boarding tickets put in hand. Now, typically, security is my least favorite part of getting on a plane, as I'm sure it is everyone else's. This time, however, was easily the smoothest, best experience I had ever had seeing as there was literally no one else in line. With no one in front, and no one behind, I just took my time! All the security TSA staff seemed to be very relaxed and at ease, no one was harsh or overly tense about getting a horde of people through to their gates in time, just a nice comfortable pace to take my shoes off, thank you. What I would give to have it always be like that I swear. Once through security, we only had to go a few yards before we were right at our gate with practically everyone else who was headed out to Qatar, and there we settled in for the hour or so until departure.\n\n<div class=\"captioned-image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dfkk9455p/image/upload/v1607410573/O_Hare_Airplane_nhposk.jpg\" alt=\"A selfie of Gita and myself aboard our flight to Qatar sporting face masks and face shields provided by Qatar Airways\" title=\"Suited up and ready to fly\" /><div class=\"image-caption\">Adorned with face mask and shield, we were ready to fly (albeit nervously!).</div></div>\n\nOnce on board the plane, we were very shocked to see just how many people would be flying with us- it was a full house! Thankfully, as part of the flight safety policies in place by Qatar Airways, we were given face masks and face shields and required to wear both for the full length of the flight. While extremely awkward (and slightly suffocating), the combination of the two certainly gave us the impression of security!\n\nThe flight itself was fairly unremarkable, mostly just shifting around in our seats trying not to suffocate under the mask-and-shield combo and grasping at entertainment. I managed to plow through 3 films ([Ad Astra](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2935510/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0), [ورد مسموم (Poisonous Roses)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7866918/), and one really charming 1997 movie with Bill Murray, \"[The Man Who Knew Too Little](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120483/)\", in case anyone was curious!) but other than that we just tried to sleep!\n\n<div class=\"captioned-image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dfkk9455p/image/upload/v1607496461/Sleeping_on_Plane_to_Qatar_nqy1cb.jpg\" alt=\"Isaac sleeping on the plane with a face mask, face shield, and eye mask to prevent the light from the seats in front from keeping him awake.\" title=\"Sleeping on a plane - COVID edition\" /><div class=\"image-caption\">Sleeping on a plane in 2020 has never been more uncomfortable!</div></div>\n\n# Bangkok Bound\n\nAs we neared Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar, I followed along closely on the map picturing in my head all the countries we were flying over- Turkey, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and how badly I'd love to go there some day. Once we touched down in Doha, I stared out the window in disbelief- my dream of visiting the Middle East finally realized, sort of! The deplaning process was a breeze, and getting through the airport to our next gate was no problem at all. Gita and I were very surprised at how fluent many of the airport staff and various crew were, and how often they chose to speak in English to one another instead of, presumably, Arabic. It certainly made things easier for us!\n\nWe grabbed a quick bite to eat at a ramen shop in the cafeteria and made our way to the gate for our flight to Bangkok!\n\n<div class=\"captioned-image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dfkk9455p/image/upload/v1607410639/Doha_Airport_Stuffed_Bear_dw3cyu.jpg\" alt=\"The large central room of the Hamad International Airport featuring an usual, large bear statue fused with a lamp\" title=\"Bear and lamp sculpture in the Hamad International Airport\" /><div class=\"image-caption\">We found this funky bear and lamp statue titled 'Untitled Lamp Bear' by the Swiss artist Urs Fischer.</div></div>\n\nWe were honestly quite surprised by the number of people getting on our flight. It was significantly fewer than the number of people leaving O'Hare with us, but there was a very decent number! We once again had to show all of our various paperwork and documents but thankfully the staff seemed to be very well versed in the documents needed and we were prepared. Once through that initial security check-in (the person I checked-in with asked if I was certain I intended on going to Thailand- I should definitely hope so!) we took our seats in this large enclosed space and waited for our boarding group to be called.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n      <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pNHwplgAuOk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    </div>\n\nThe second flight was ***much*** shorter by comparison to the first, only 5 hours and with ample room to spread out as we were only two to a row. The plane itself was also a great deal emptier with far fewer people on board, making us feel much more comfortable. We were, however, still required to wear the mask and shield as is customary on all Qatar Airways flights, currently.\n\n<div class=\"captioned-image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dfkk9455p/image/upload/v1607410628/Gita_Look_Out_Window_yz5u3u.jpg\" alt=\"Gita looking out the window of our airplane headed in to Bangkok\" title=\"Gita looking out the plane window\" /><div class=\"image-caption\">Bangkok bound!</div></div>\n\n# Arriving in Bangkok\n\nAnd so, 5 fours later, we found ourselves on Thai soil in Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport! The deplaning process was absolutely impressive. The whole process began with us being escorted from our gate directly to a holding area at the entrance to the terminal where all these chairs were positioned, one for each passenger on the aircraft. There we were attended to individually by an army of nurses who came with forms for us to fill out, as well as reviewing our documents for yet another time. Once we completed the forms we were directed to another step of checking papers where we were asked if we presented any symptoms, and then we were shuffled off to a second holding section where we waited to be called up to the border.\n\n<div class=\"captioned-image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dfkk9455p/image/upload/v1607410544/Bangkok_Airport_eypi9f.jpg\" alt=\"Gita siting among others in a holding section of the Bangkok International Airport waiting to be called up to the border while being monitored by armed guards and medical professionals.\" title=\"Armed guards and medical professionals kept an eye on us.\" /><div class=\"image-caption\">As soon as we were off the plane Thailand wowed use with their efficiency and professionalism in keeping their country safe from the coronavirus.</div></div>\n\nOnce our group was summoned, we made our way to a preliminary border checkpoint where they checked our papers, again, and then were directed to the actual border. Here we provided fingerprints, a photograph, and, yes, you guessed it, our papers (and passports). Once through, we headed straight for baggage claim to see if Gita's notoriously bad luck with luggage would cut her some slack on this journey. Much to our surprise and happiness, her luggage came! It might seem silly but if you only knew the half of how much trouble we've had in the past...\n\n# The Shuttle to Our ASQ\n\nHaving finally made our way through the clean-machine that was Thailand's immigration process we made our way out the door of the airport. The moment we stepped through the exit we were approached by a staff member wearing full PPE who called out \"Gita? Isaac? Going to the Rembrandt Hotel?\", which of course was us and so we nodded. We were then immediately guided to our shuttle bus which was already idling by in anticipation of our arrival- they really wasted no time! Once our luggage was placed in back we got in the bus, put on new face masks and shoe coverings and settled in for the drive.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n      <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/https://youtu.be/udYK3hBniM0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    </div>\n\nThe drive was pretty remarkable seeing as we arrived to the city just after sunrise, meaning we were headed in during the height of rush hour into one of the busiest, densest cities on Earth. It's an understatement to say that traffic was bad. Thankfully, Gita and I were entirely left to enjoy the view which we took full advantage of, ogling out the window at the country which had just welcomed us past it borders.\n\n<div class=\"captioned-image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dfkk9455p/image/upload/v1607410576/King_Picture_Bangkok_Shuttle_pj8izy.jpg\" alt=\"A tribute to the king alongside a highway leading in to Bangkok\" title=\"Tributes to the king were common all along the roads in to Bangkok\" /><div class=\"image-caption\">We saw many tributes like these depicting the king are common along the roads in to Bangkok, as well as small pendants hanging from the rearview mirrors in cars.</div></div>\n\nBangkok really did take us by surprise with all the noise and movement on the streets contrasting with the greenery just outside of the city. Once we were further along in the ride (which, by the way, was an hour and a half long to go 25 kilometers!) we got a good look at the farthest sprawl of the city and high-rises.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n      <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fr-bAn0c3jE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    </div>\n\nOnce we made it further downtown the life of the city really began to appear as we were swarmed by herds of motorcyclists and scooters while shopkeepers opened up their stores to start the day. All around us were people of all walks of life commuting through their daily routines in the busiest city on Earth, and we were sectioned off inside our shuttle for their safety.\n\n<div class=\"captioned-image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/dfkk9455p/image/upload/v1607410628/Motorcycle_from_Shuttle_Window_bxy0eb.jpg\" alt=\"A motorcyclist waits behind a pickup truck at a stoplight in Bangkok\" title=\"One of many motorcyclists\" /><div class=\"image-caption\">The streets were full of vehicles of all shapes and sizes, but none quite as fun to watch zip by as all the scooters and motorcycles. We can't wait to have ones of our own!</div></div>\n\n# The Quarantine Hotel\n\nOnce we finally arrived at the Rembrandt Hotel Gita and I were guided off one at a time to check in with a nurse and other staff members to be informed on what the next few days would be like. After adding their contacts to our phones and installing a health monitoring app called COSTE, Gita and I were separated off in to our own rooms, just 5 doors down from one another on the 11th floor.\n\n<div class=\"video-container\">\n      <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5RxcyeqtitY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    </div>\n\nAnd that's pretty much it! Here we stay until the 17th of December where we will be transported off to Hua Hin for our final orientation before starting our jobs in Prachuapkirikhan. Look out for the next post!\n\n![A view of my room in the Rembrandt Hotel in room number 1105 ](https://res.cloudinary.com/dfkk9455p/image/upload/v1607410604/Rembrandt_Hotel_Room_yb964d.jpg \"My quarantine stay\")",
