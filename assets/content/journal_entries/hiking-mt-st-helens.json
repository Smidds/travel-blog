  "body": "So we'd decided to climb Mt. St. Helens.\n\nW﻿ell, climb isn't exactly fair. Since the volcano erupted in 1980 there hasn't really been much \"climbing\" to be had to the summit of the mountain, more like a fairly strenuous hike. So, really, we had decided to hike to the top of Mt. St. Helens. In order to pull off such a feat you really don't need much, just a permit, some water, and a good pair of shoes. We got all our gear together Thursday evening, turned off our Outlook and Teams notifications, and drove off into the Washington wilderness.\n\n# \"﻿Base Camp\"\n\nW﻿e decided to set up camp at the Climber's Bivouac Trailhead. This very popular starting point for those wishing to summit Mt. St. Helens had ample space for anyone wanting to car camp as well as a handful of great tent camping sites. Unfortunately, no water was at the campsite, but we planned ahead and brought about a gallon or so (which spilled all over the back of the car where I decided to leave it unsecured despite Gita's suggestions to do otherwise) which kept us plenty hydrated. T﻿he actual camping itself was nothing to write about except that we were regularly woken up to the lights and sounds of people coming and going from the campsite.\n\n# T﻿he Ascent\n\nR﻿ight at the trailhead we were unpleasantly informed that the forest service does not allow any waste to be left behind. ***Any***. Thankfully, [GO Anywhere bags](https://www.rei.com/product/692303/cleanwaste-go-anywhere-toilet-kit-waste-bag) are provided free of charge for you to grab, but relieving yourself into a bag really kills the mountain climbing vibes, to be sure. Anyway, past the free goodies was a permitting station so the forest service can keep track of climbers, and then off and away is the trail!\n\nT﻿he beginning of the climb was easy, straightforward, and dare I say a little boring if you're used to PNW hikes. We started around 7ish when it was a little chilly in the air and once we made our way to the boulder fields it had warmed up enough that we were sleeves rolled up and drinking water. At this point we really didn't know where the trail was and after a few head scratching moments decided we'd better look around and see what everyone else ahead of us was doing. There, off in the distance, we spotted these lovely white logs-cairns, which acted as our guide from that point onward all up the boulders.\n\nT﻿he traversal was a little rough to be sure, with small rocks sliding as you stepped and large boulder completely obscuring the way. To be clear, there really isn't much of a specific trail for several portions of this initial boulder field, more like a general direction to work towards those log-cairns. Once we came onto and over Monitor Ridge, though, there was a fairly clear path with nearly no scrambling. It was only once we got closer to the GPS tracking station that was along the trail did it really get tricky. Honestly though it was a ton of fun, nothing is quite as cool or breathtaking as doing some really gentle bouldering with the Washington valleys and a clear blue sky as the backdrop.\n\nThat is one thing to be careful of (which I certainly wasn't), the complete lack of shade and sun cover. I pretty much burned my entire neck and a fair portion of my face, and once we got higher and higher up on the ridgeline you really start to feel the sun beating down on you. We were thankfully hiking later in the season so the sun never got quite so high and it wasn't too hot, so I highly recommend going around the end of September if the weather looks good!\n\nA﻿nyway, after the trail along Monitor Ridge gives way to that hand-over-hand low-key bouldering it's a little slow going to the next real resting point which is near a GPS tracking station. We ate some snacks there and then set off for the final portion of the hike along scree and an ashy-sandy-rocky sediment."
